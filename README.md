Comparative analysis of Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC) and XGBoost in predicting match outcomes using Mobile Legends M6 dataset.
# 🧠 M6 Match Prediction using GPC & XGBoost

This repository contains the implementation of a comparative analysis between Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC) and XGBoost in predicting match outcomes in the **Mobile Legends M6 World Championship** dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview
The objective of this research is to compare the performance of two classification algorithms — GPC and XGBoost — on esports data, specifically Mobile Legends M6 match results. Evaluation is based on metrics such as **Accuracy**, **F1-Score**, **Confusion Matrix**, and **ROC Curve**.


## 📊 Algorithms Used
- Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC)
- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. git clone https://github.com/irgiahmad/m6-match-prediction-gpc-xgboost.git

2. Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py


## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve

## 📌 Results
- XGBoost outperformed GPC in both accuracy and F1-score.
- GPC showed more conservative predictions with higher bias.
- Dataset quality and class imbalance also influenced the results.
